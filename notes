## Notes
- Bad? Carries away topsoil (to stream channels)
- Where? "where soils are tight, shallow, and wet, vegetation is poor and thin, and rainfall is heavy and intense"
- The photos and captions are the most damning. 
- raindrops traveling at 14mph can carry away as much as 40% of soil. Good cover crops will help prevent destructive soil splash erosion. Contouring rows of plants also helps prevent runoff.
